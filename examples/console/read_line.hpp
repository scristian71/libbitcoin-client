/*
 * Reads lines from the terminal in a separate thread.
 *
 * A networking thread cannot use the C++ standard library to read from the
 * terminal. Once the thread calls std::cin.getline or similar, it becomes
 * stuck until the user types something, so the thread cannot handle network
 * events at the same time. Therefore, the network stuff and the terminal
 * stuff need to run in separate threads.
 *
 * The simplest solution is to create a thread that simply reads from the
 * terminal and transmits the results over a zeromq inproc socket. The main
 * thread sends an empty REQ message when it wants to read from the terminal,
 * and the reader thread sends back a REP message with whatever the user
 * typed. If the main thread sends a non-empty REQ message, the thread quits.
 *
 * To use this class, first call `show_prompt`. This call will display a
 * command prompt and begin reading input in the background. Then, use
 * `pollitem` with `zmq_poll` to determine when the line is available. Once
 * the line is available, use `get_line` to retrieve it.
 *
 * If you attempt to destroy this class while reading a line, the destructor
 * will block until the user finishes their entry.
